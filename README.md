# Raasta
## Our submission for the problem statement by PwC at Megathon'19 

'Raasta' solves the problems of water drainage in modern cities by sending drones to waterlogged areas.
 
This repository includes the algorithm for where to send the drones and also an android application that simulates how the drone redirects traffic.
